# News-Extraction

- This is my first repository where I have tried news extraction using python
- From the news webpage, I have extracted the headlines, keyword, image URL, source URL, author, summary of each news article on that web page
- After extracting the data, I have created a front-end to display it using HTML and CSS

# Objective

- Extraction is the process of removing required data from a source
- Here the source is a news website, Inshorts (https://www.inshorts.com/en/read)
- Ultimately the data extracted is in the form of string. After extracting the data, I have tried to parse it
- Parsing is a method where one string of data gets converted into different forms of data

# Technologies used

- I have written the source code in python with the help of some libraries and built-in functions
- The libraries I've used are 'requests', 'bs4 (BeautifulSoup4)' and 'flask'
- 'requests' to requests the access of the data from the news webpage URL
- 'bs4 (BeautifulSoup4)' to parse the data in the required form
- 'flask' to build the web application
- The source code 'test.py' can run on any IDE that supports python 3 and has the above libraries installed
- You will also need a search engine to view the website

# Code Output

- After running the code, the code will host a server of a webpage which has the code output
- The webpage is written in HTML and CSS
